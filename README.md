1) Complete the Intro Discussion as soon as possible to introduce yourself to your classmates. Create a YouTube video of your class introduction instead of writing your answers to the discussion prompt, or do both (preferred!)

2) Install the free version of PyCharm. Watch the Tech with Tim video on installing PyCharm a couple of times and get comfortable with your programming environment. 

3) Watch the Giraffe Academy video in bits and pieces. Don't watch it all at once - just watch a part here and a part there: see what you're going to be coding. Get comfortable recognizing Python code.

4) Read, study, and code up examples from Chapters 1-3 of our textbook. A PDF of our textbook is on Canvas, as well as the HTML version, and distinct chapters and their PowerPoints are in the module.

5) Submit any and all code you create for this module to the GitHub Classroom remote repository.

6) Complete the Module One Reflexion discussion post - this is used for attendance in our online class.

I will create a quiz covering Chapters 1-3 in the next day or two, so make sure to take the quiz by the end of this module.

Tell me (using an online submission for this assignment named: Module 1 Activities) that you completed all the activities in this assignment, and if your code looks good in your GitHub Classroom repo, you will receive full credit for this assignment!
